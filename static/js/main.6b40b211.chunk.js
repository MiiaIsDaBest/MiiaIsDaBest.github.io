Just having you with me (even though you are on the other side of the world) is so nice. I know it must probably be a bothersome to you that I want to be with you.

But sometimes I look back at your drawings, like go through your twitter and then you can see how much you have improved. It shows the effort you have put in it. It's just amazing, you also have gained quite a following already. More than 1000 on Facebook already, is hecking amazing. Also is extra proof that your drawings are really nice."}),Object(d.jsx)("p",{children:"I'm also really grateful to have you as a friend. You're always there for me. You don't complain when I write you walls of text. You listen to my problems and try to help me. You have helped me with trying to discover my sexuality further. It's also really fun to spend time with you like I said before. Whether we talk, play something, I can watch stream while listening to your voice. Hearing your beautiful voice while you sing or hear you play on an instrument. Heck this reminds another amazing thing. You can play 2 instruments. Piano and ukulele, I know you say you can't play very much on them but I still find it amazing and you're also really good at the ones that you can play.
